Hi... ğŸ¤— 

This is the web-application design which I created for my first assignment under the subject of Web-Programming part-1; in my degree program. Basically this web-application is designed for a Electronic shop to sell their products online. First I gathered some references and designed the basics using Figma. After I satisfied with my design I coded it using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap(Framework) and JavaScript.

This web application have following pages ğŸ‘‡ 
> Customer Login and Sign Up
> Home Page
> Single Product view
> Cart and Watchlist 
> Purchased history 
> Admin Sign In
> Admin Panel
> Manage Products and Manage User(through the admin panel)
